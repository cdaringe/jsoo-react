{0 [jsoo-react]}

{1 Introduction}

This package includes the bindings to the JavaScript library {{:https://reactjs.org}React.js}
for the [js_of_ocaml] compiler, including JSX ppx.

Inspired by {{:https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/}ReasonReact}.

{2 Hello world}

Creating a component in OCaml syntax:

{[ 
  let make () =
    (div ~children:[React.string "Hello world"] () [@JSX])
    [@@react.component]
]}

And in Reason syntax:

{[ 
  [@react.component]
  let make = () => {
    <div> {"Hello World" |> React.string} </div>;
  };
]}

{1 Library [jsoo-react.lib]}

This library provides access to the bindings of the JavaScript packages [react]
and [react-dom].

To read the detailed documentation of the bindings API, see the docs for the entry 
point module {!React}.

{1 Pre-processing extension [jsoo-react.ppx]}

This ppx main purpose is to auto-generate code to transform the individually labelled arguments
passed to elements as props (e.g. [div ~foo ~bar ()]) into a single JavaScript object that contains the values
as properties ([{foo: foo, bar: bar}]).
